## What is Index Form ?
Index form is a way of expressing a number that is multiplied by itself.

The ^ symbol is used to represent a number's index value as follows.

2 x 2 x 2 = 2^3

It can also be written as smaller number next to the number being multiplied.

2<sup>3</sup>

`Other terms for Index are Exponent or Power.`
